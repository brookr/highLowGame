Hopefully your game is coming along nicely. Ready to take it to the next level?

Review the data structures we discussed in class (slides here). Read up more on
any that interest you,or you are fuzzy on.

Integrate a data structure into your game. Maybe you can record user actions in
a queue, and then play them back to display at the end. Or maybe you want to
create a tree diagram of all possible card hands. Or maybe a binary search type
algorithm could provide hints in your guessing game?

You decide. If you are feeling behind at this point, take this week to catch up
on getting your game working well, and add this level of complexity after the
course has concluded. No penalty for late submissions."
